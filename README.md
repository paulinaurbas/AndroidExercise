A simple arcade game involving bouncing the ball off the opposite edges of the screen using device movements (accelerometer or gyroscope).

## How it works?
The ball was drawn using OpenGL to draw a blue ball (a circle with a radius of 10% of the length of the long edge of the device screen) on a green background. The ball track was a straight line that cuts the short edges of the screen in half. The movement of the ball was related to the movement of the device.
